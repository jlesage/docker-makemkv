This project provides a Docker container for [MakeMKV](https://www.makemkv.com).

The graphical user interface (GUI) of the application can be accessed through a
modern web browser, requiring no installation or configuration on the client
side, or via any VNC client.

A fully automated mode is also available: insert a DVD or Blu-ray disc into an
optical drive and let MakeMKV rips it without any user interaction.

MakeMKV is your one-click solution to convert video that you own into free and
patents-unencumbered format that can be played everywhere. MakeMKV is a format
converter, otherwise called "transcoder". It converts the video clips from
proprietary (and usually encrypted) disc into a set of MKV files, preserving
most information but not changing it in any way. The MKV format can store
multiple video/audio tracks with all meta-information and preserve chapters.

## Quick Start

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Docker command provided in this quick start is an example, and parameters
> should be adjusted to suit your needs.

Launch the MakeMKV docker container with the following command:

```shell
docker run -d \
    --name=makemkv \
    -p 5800:5800 \
    -v /docker/appdata/makemkv:/config:rw \
    -v /home/user:/storage:ro \
    -v /home/user/MakeMKV/output:/output:rw \
    --device /dev/sr0 \
    --device /dev/sg2 \
    jlesage/makemkv
```

Where:

  - `/docker/appdata/makemkv`: Stores the application's configuration, state, logs, and any files requiring persistency.
  - `/home/user`: Contains files from the host that need to be accessible to the application.
  - `/home/user/MakeMKV/output`: This is where extracted videos are written.
  - `/dev/sr0`: First linux device file corresponding to the optical drive.
  - `/dev/sg2`: Second linux device file corresponding to the optical drive.

Access the MakeMKV GUI by browsing to `http://your-host-ip:5800`.
Files from the host appear under the `/storage` folder in the container.

## Usage

```shell
docker run [-d] \
    --name=makemkv \
    [-e <VARIABLE_NAME>=<VALUE>]... \
    [-v <HOST_DIR>:<CONTAINER_DIR>[:PERMISSIONS]]... \
    [-p <HOST_PORT>:<CONTAINER_PORT>]... \
    jlesage/makemkv
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| -d        | Runs the container in the background. If not set, the container runs in the foreground. |
| -e        | Passes an environment variable to the container. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for details. |
| -v        | Sets a volume mapping to share a folder or file between the host and the container. See [Data Volumes](#data-volumes) for details. |
| -p        | Sets a network port mapping to expose an internal container port to the host). See [Ports](#ports) for details. |

### Environment Variables

To customize the container's behavior, you can pass environment variables using
the `-e` parameter in the format `<VARIABLE_NAME>=<VALUE>`.

| Variable       | Description                                  | Default |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|---------|
|`USER_ID`| ID of the user the application runs as. See [User/Group IDs](#usergroup-ids) for details. | `1000` |
|`GROUP_ID`| ID of the group the application runs as. See [User/Group IDs](#usergroup-ids) for details. | `1000` |
|`SUP_GROUP_IDS`| Comma-separated list of supplementary group IDs for the application. | (no value) |
|`UMASK`| Mask controlling permissions for newly created files and folders, specified in octal notation. By default, `0022` ensures files and folders are readable by all but writable only by the owner. See the umask calculator at http://wintelguy.com/umask-calc.pl. | `0022` |
|`LANG`| Sets the [locale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale_(computer_software)), defining the application's language, if supported. Format is `language[_territory][.codeset]`, where language is an [ISO 639 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes), territory is an [ISO 3166 country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes), and codeset is a character set, like `UTF-8`. For example, Australian English using UTF-8 is `en_AU.UTF-8`. | `en_US.UTF-8` |
|`TZ`| [TimeZone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) used by the container. The timezone can also be set by mapping `/etc/localtime` between the host and the container. | `Etc/UTC` |
|`KEEP_APP_RUNNING`| When set to `1`, the application is automatically restarted if it crashes or terminates. | `0` |
|`APP_NICENESS`| Priority at which the application runs. A niceness value of -20 is the highest, 19 is the lowest and 0 the default. **NOTE**: A negative niceness (priority increase) requires additional permissions. The container must be run with the Docker option `--cap-add=SYS_NICE`. | `0` |
|`INSTALL_PACKAGES`| Space-separated list of packages to install during container startup. List of available packages can be found at https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org. | (no value) |
|`PACKAGES_MIRROR`| Mirror of the repository to use when installing packages. List of mirrors is available at https://mirrors.alpinelinux.org. | (no value) |
|`CONTAINER_DEBUG`| When set to `1`, enables debug logging. | `0` |
|`DISPLAY_WIDTH`| Width (in pixels) of the application's window. | `1920` |
|`DISPLAY_HEIGHT`| Height (in pixels) of the application's window. | `1080` |
|`DARK_MODE`| When set to `1`, enables dark mode for the application. See Dark Mode](#dark-mode) for details. | `0` |
|`WEB_AUDIO`| When set to `1`, enables audio support, allowing audio produced by the application to play through the browser. See [Web Audio](#web-audio) for details. | `0` |
|`WEB_FILE_MANAGER`| When set to `1`, enables the web file manager, allowing interaction with files inside the container through the web browser, supporting operations like renaming, deleting, uploading, and downloading. See [Web File Manager](#web-file-manager) for details. | `0` |
|`WEB_FILE_MANAGER_ALLOWED_PATHS`| Comma-separated list of paths within the container that the file manager can access. By default, the container's entire filesystem is not accessible, and this variable specifies allowed paths. If set to `AUTO`, commonly used folders and those mapped to the container are automatically allowed. The value `ALL` allows access to all paths (no restrictions). See [Web File Manager](#web-file-manager) for details. | `AUTO` |
|`WEB_FILE_MANAGER_DENIED_PATHS`| Comma-separated list of paths within the container that the file manager cannot access. A denied path takes precedence over an allowed path. See [Web File Manager](#web-file-manager) for details. | (no value) |
|`WEB_AUTHENTICATION`| When set to `1`, protects the application's GUI with a login page when accessed via a web browser. Access is granted only with valid credentials. This feature requires the secure connection to be enabled. See [Web Authentication](#web-authentication) for details. | `0` |
|`WEB_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN_VALIDITY_TIME`| Lifetime of a token, in hours. A token is assigned to the user after successful login. As long as the token is valid, the user can access the application's GUI without logging in again. Once the token expires, the login page is displayed again. | `24` |
|`WEB_AUTHENTICATION_USERNAME`| Optional username for web authentication. Provides a quick and easy way to configure credentials for a single user. For more secure configuration or multiple users, see the [Web Authentication](#web-authentication) section. | (no value) |
|`WEB_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD`| Optional password for web authentication. Provides a quick and easy way to configure credentials for a single user. For more secure configuration or multiple users, see the [Web Authentication](#web-authentication) section. | (no value) |
|`SECURE_CONNECTION`| When set to `1`, uses an encrypted connection to access the application's GUI (via web browser or VNC client). See [Security](#security) for details. | `0` |
|`SECURE_CONNECTION_VNC_METHOD`| Method used for encrypted VNC connections. Possible values are `SSL` or `TLS`. See [Security](#security) for details. | `SSL` |
|`SECURE_CONNECTION_CERTS_CHECK_INTERVAL`| Interval, in seconds, at which the system checks if web or VNC certificates have changed. When a change is detected, affected services are automatically restarted. A value of `0` disables the check. | `60` |
|`WEB_LISTENING_PORT`| Port used by the web server to serve the application's GUI. This port is internal to the container and typically does not need to be changed. By default, a container uses the default bridge network, requiring each internal port to be mapped to an external port (using the `-p` or `--publish` argument). If another network type is used, changing this port may prevent conflicts with other services/containers. **NOTE**: A value of `-1` disables HTTP/HTTPS access to the application's GUI. | `5800` |
|`VNC_LISTENING_PORT`| Port used by the VNC server to serve the application's GUI. This port is internal to the container and typically does not need to be changed. By default, a container uses the default bridge network, requiring each internal port to be mapped to an external port (using the `-p` or `--publish` argument). If another network type is used, changing this port may prevent conflicts with other services/containers. **NOTE**: A value of `-1` disables VNC access to the application's GUI. | `5900` |
|`VNC_PASSWORD`| Password required to connect to the application's GUI. See the [VNC Password](#vnc-password) section for details. | (no value) |
|`ENABLE_CJK_FONT`| When set to `1`, installs the open-source font `WenQuanYi Zen Hei`, supporting a wide range of Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters. | `0` |
|`MAKEMKV_KEY`| MakeMKV registration key to use. The key is written to the configuration file during container startup. When set to `BETA`, the latest beta key is automatically used. When set to `UNSET`, no key is automatically written to the configuration file. | `BETA` |
|`MAKEMKV_GUI`| Setting this to `1` enables the MakeMKV, `0` disables it. | `1` |
|`AUTO_DISC_RIPPER`| When set to `1`, the automatic disc ripper is enabled. | `0` |
|`AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_MAKEMKV_PROFILE`| Filename of the custom MakeMKV profile the automatic disc ripper should use. The profile is expected to be found under the `/config` folder of the container, unless an absolute path is specified. | (no value) |
|`AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_EJECT`| When set to `1`, disc is ejected from the drive when ripping is terminated. | `0` |
|`AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_PARALLEL_RIP`| When set to `1`, discs from all available optical drives are ripped in parallel. Else, each disc from optical drives is ripped one at time. | `0` |
|`AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_INTERVAL`| Interval, in seconds, the automatic disc ripper checks for the presence of a DVD/Blu-ray discs. | `5` |
|`AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_MIN_TITLE_LENGTH`| Titles with a length less than this value are ignored. Length is in seconds. By default, no value is set, meaning that value from MakeMKV's configuration file is taken. | (no value) |
|`AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_BD_MODE`| Rip mode of Blu-ray discs. `mkv` is the default mode, where a set of MKV files are produced. When set to `backup`, a copy of the (decrypted) file system of the disc is created instead. | `mkv` |
|`AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_DVD_MODE`| Rip mode of DVD discs. `mkv` is the default mode, where a set of MKV files are produced. When set to `backup`, a copy of the (decrypted) file system of the disc is instead created as an ISO file. | `mkv` |
|`AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_FORCE_UNIQUE_OUTPUT_DIR`| When set to `0`, files are written to `/output/DISC_LABEL/`, where `DISC_LABEL` is the label/name of the disc. If this directory exists, then files are written to `/output/DISC_LABEL-XXXXXX`, where `XXXXXX` are random readable characters. When set to `1`, the `/output/DISC_LABEL-XXXXXX` pattern is always used. | `0` |
|`AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_NO_GUI_PROGRESS`| When set to `1`, progress of discs ripped by the automatic disc ripper is not shown in the MakeMKV GUI. | `0` |
|`ENABLE_DOCKER_LOGGING`| When set to `1`, streams all MakeMKV output to Docker stdout for better container monitoring. Automatically enabled if notification support is configured. | `0` |
|`NOTIFY_START`| When set to `1` and notifications are configured, sends a notification when a rip starts. | `1` |

#### Deployment Considerations

Many tools used to manage Docker containers extract environment variables
defined by the Docker image to create or deploy the container.

For example, this behavior is seen in:
  - The Docker application on Synology NAS
  - The Container Station on QNAP NAS
  - Portainer
  - etc.

While this is useful for users to adjust environment variable values to suit
their needs, keeping all of them can be confusing and even risky.

A good practice is to set or retain only the variables necessary for the
container to function as desired in your setup. If a variable is left at its
default value, it can be removed. Keep in mind that all environment variables
are optional; none are required for the container to start.

Removing unneeded environment variables offers several benefits:

  - Prevents retaining variables no longer used by the container. Over time,
    with image updates, some variables may become obsolete.
  - Allows the Docker image to update or fix default values. With image updates,
    default values may change to address issues or support new features.
  - Avoids changes to variables that could disrupt the container's
    functionality. Some undocumented variables, like `PATH` or `ENV`, are
    required but not meant to be modified by users, yet container management
    tools may expose them.
  - Addresses a bug in Container Station on QNAP and the Docker application on
    Synology, where variables without values may not be allowed. This behavior
    is incorrect, as variables without values are valid. Removing unneeded
    variables prevents deployment issues on these devices.

### Data Volumes

The following table describes the data volumes used by the container. Volume
mappings are set using the `-v` parameter with a value in the format
`<HOST_DIR>:<CONTAINER_DIR>[:PERMISSIONS]`.

| Container path  | Permissions | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
|`/config`| rw | Stores the application's configuration, state, logs, and any files requiring persistency. |
|`/storage`| ro | Contains files from the host that need to be accessible to the application. |
|`/output`| rw | This is where extracted videos are written. |

### Ports

The following table lists the ports used by the container.

When using the default bridge network, ports can be mapped to the host using the
`-p` parameter with value in the format `<HOST_PORT>:<CONTAINER_PORT>`. The
internal container port may not be changeable, but you can use any port on the
host side.

See the Docker [Docker Container Networking](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking)
documentation for details.

| Port | Protocol | Mapping to Host | Description |
|------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| 5800 | TCP | Optional | Port to access the application's GUI via the web interface. Mapping to the host is optional if web access is not needed. For non-default bridge networks, the port can be changed with the `WEB_LISTENING_PORT` environment variable. |
| 5900 | TCP | Optional | Port to access the application's GUI via the VNC protocol. Mapping to the host is optional if VNC access is not needed. For non-default bridge networks, the port can be changed with the `VNC_LISTENING_PORT` environment variable. |

### Changing Parameters of a Running Container

Environment variables, volume mappings, and port mappings are specified when
creating the container. To modify these parameters for an existing container,
follow these steps:

  1. Stop the container (if it is running):
```shell
docker stop makemkv
```

  2. Remove the container:
```shell
docker rm makemkv
```

  3. Recreate and start the container using the `docker run` command, adjusting
     parameters as needed.

> [!NOTE]
> Since all application data is saved under the `/config` container folder,
> destroying and recreating the container does not result in data loss, and the
> application resumes with the same state, provided the `/config` folder
> mapping remains unchanged.

### Docker Compose File

Below is an example `docker-compose.yml` file for use with
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/).

Adjust the configuration to suit your needs. Only mandatory settings are
included in this example.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  makemkv:
    image: jlesage/makemkv
    ports:
      - "5800:5800"
    volumes:
      - "/docker/appdata/makemkv:/config:rw"
      - "/home/user:/storage:ro"
      - "/home/user/MakeMKV/output:/output:rw"
    devices:
      - "/dev/sr0:/dev/sr0"
      - "/dev/sg2:/dev/sg2"
```

## Docker Image Versioning and Tags

Each release of a Docker image is versioned, and each version as its own image
tag. Before October 2022, the versioning scheme followed
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

Since then, the versioning scheme has shifted to
[calendar versioning](https://calver.org) with the format `YY.MM.SEQUENCE`,
where:
  - `YY` is the zero-padded year (relative to year 2000).
  - `MM` is the zero-padded month.
  - `SEQUENCE` is the incremental release number within the month (first release
    is 1, second is 2, etc).

View all available tags on [Docker Hub] or check the [Releases] page for version
details.

[Releases]: https://github.com/jlesage/docker-makemkv/releases
[Docker Hub]: https://hub.docker.com/r/jlesage/makemkv/tags

## Docker Image Update

The Docker image is regularly updated to incorporate new features, fix issues,
or integrate newer versions of the containerized application. Several methods
can be used to update the Docker image.

If your system provides a built-in method for updating containers, this should
be your primary approach.

Alternatively, you can use [Watchtower], a container-based solution for
automating Docker image updates. Watchtower seamlessly handles updates when a
new image is available.

To manually update the Docker image, follow these steps:

  1. Fetch the latest image:
```shell
docker pull jlesage/makemkv
```

  2. Stop the container:
```shell
docker stop makemkv
```

  3. Remove the container:
```shell
docker rm makemkv
```

  4. Recreate and start the container using the `docker run` command, with the
     same parameters used during initial deployment.

[Watchtower]: https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower

### Synology

For Synology NAS users, follow these steps to update a container image:

  1.  Open the *Docker* application.
  2.  Click *Registry* in the left pane.
  3.  In the search bar, type the name of the container (`jlesage/makemkv`).
  4.  Select the image, click *Download*, and choose the `latest` tag.
  5.  Wait for the download to complete. A notification will appear once done.
  6.  Click *Container* in the left pane.
  7.  Select your MakeMKV container.
  8.  Stop it by clicking *Action* -> *Stop*.
  9.  Clear the container by clicking *Action* -> *Reset* (or *Action* ->
      *Clear* if you don't have the latest *Docker* application). This removes
      the container while keeping its configuration.
  10. Start the container again by clicking *Action* -> *Start*. **NOTE**:  The
      container may temporarily disappear from the list while it is recreated.

### unRAID

For unRAID users, update a container image with these steps:

  1. Select the *Docker* tab.
  2. Click the *Check for Updates* button at the bottom of the page.
  3. Click the *apply update* link of the container to be updated.

## User/Group IDs

When mapping data volumes (using the `-v` flag of the `docker run` command),
permission issues may arise between the host and the container. Files and
folders in a data volume are owned by a user, which may differ from the user
running the application. Depending on permissions, this could prevent the
container from accessing the shared volume.

To avoid this, specify the user the application should run as using the
`USER_ID` and `GROUP_ID` environment variables.

To find the appropriate IDs, run the following command on the host for the user
owning the data volume:

```shell
id <username>
```

This produces output like:

```
uid=1000(myuser) gid=1000(myuser) groups=1000(myuser),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),46(plugdev),113(lpadmin)
```

Use the `uid` (user ID) and `gid` (group ID) values to configure the container.

## Accessing the GUI

Assuming the container's ports are mapped to the same host's ports, access the
application's GUI as follows:

  - Via a web browser:

```text
http://<HOST_IP_ADDR>:5800
```

  - Via any VNC client:

```text
<HOST_IP_ADDR>:5900
```

## Security

By default, access to the application's GUI uses an unencrypted connection (HTTP
or VNC).

A secure connection can be enabled via the `SECURE_CONNECTION` environment
variable. See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for
details on configuring environment variables.

When enabled, the GUI is accessed over HTTPS when using a browser, with all HTTP
accesses redirected to HTTPS.

For VNC clients, the connection can be secured using on of two methods,
configured via the `SECURE_CONNECTION_VNC_METHOD` environment variable:

  - `SSL`: An SSL tunnel is used to transport the VNC connection. Few VNC
    clients supports this method; [SSVNC] is one that does.
  - `TLS`: A VNC security type negotiated during the VNC handshake. It uses TLS
    to establish a secure connection. Clients may optionally validate the
    server’s certificate. Valid certificates must be provided for this
    validation to succeed. See [Certificates](#certificates) for details.
    [TigerVNC] is a client that supports TLS encryption.

[TigerVNC]: https://tigervnc.org

### SSVNC

[SSVNC] is a VNC viewer that adds encryption to VNC connections by using an
SSL tunnel to transport the VNC traffic.

While the Linux version of [SSVNC] works well, the Windows version has issues.
At the time of writing, the latest version `1.0.30` fails with the error:

```text
ReadExact: Socket error while reading
```

For convenience, an unofficial, working version is provided here:

https://github.com/jlesage/docker-baseimage-gui/raw/master/tools/ssvnc_windows_only-1.0.30-r1.zip

This version upgrades the bundled `stunnel` to version `5.49`, resolving the
connection issues.

[SSVNC]: http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/ssvnc.html

### Certificates

The following certificate files are required by the container. If missing,
self-signed certificates are generated and used. All files are PEM-encoded x509
certificates.

| Container Path                  | Purpose                    | Content |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------|---------|
|`/config/certs/vnc-server.pem`   |VNC connection encryption.  |VNC server's private key and certificate, bundled with any root and intermediate certificates.|
|`/config/certs/web-privkey.pem`  |HTTPS connection encryption.|Web server's private key.|
|`/config/certs/web-fullchain.pem`|HTTPS connection encryption.|Web server's certificate, bundled with any root and intermediate certificates.|

> [!TIP]
> To avoid certificate validity warnings or errors in browsers or VNC clients,
> provide your own valid certificates.

> [!NOTE]
> Certificate files are monitored, and relevant services are restarted when
> changes are detected.

### VNC Password

To restrict access to your application, set a password using one of two methods:
  - Via the `VNC_PASSWORD` environment variable.
  - Via a `.vncpass_clear` file at the root of the `/config` volume, containing
    the password in clear text. During container startup, the content is
    obfuscated and moved to `.vncpass`.

The security of the VNC password depends on:
  - The communication channel (encrypted or unencrypted).
  - The security of host access.

When using a VNC password, enable a secure connection to prevent sending the
password in clear text over an unencrypted channel.

Unauthorized users with sufficient host privileges can retrieve the password by:

  - Viewing the `VNC_PASSWORD` environment variable via `docker inspect`. By
    default, the `docker` command requires root access, but it can be configured
    to allow users in a specific group.
  - Decrypting the `/config/.vncpass` file, which requires root or `USER_ID`
    permissions.

> [!CAUTION]
> VNC password is limited to 8 characters. This limitation comes from the Remote
> Framebuffer Protocol [RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6143) (see section
> [7.2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6143#section-7.2.2)).

### Web Authentication

Access to the application's GUI via a web browser can be protected with a login
page. When enabled, users must provide valid credentials to gain access.

Enable web authentication by setting the `WEB_AUTHENTICATION` environment
variable to `1`. See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section
for details on configuring environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Web authentication requires a secure connection to be enabled. See
> [Security](#security) for details.

#### Configuring Users Credentials

User credentials can be configured in two ways:

  1. Via container environment variables.
  2. Via a password database.

Container environment variables provide a quick way to configure a single user.
Set the username and password using:
  - `WEB_AUTHENTICATION_USERNAME`
  - `WEB_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD`

See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for details on
configuring environment variables.

For a more secure method or to configure multiple users, use a password database
at `/config/webauth-htpasswd` within the container. This file uses the Apache
HTTP server's htpasswd format, storing bcrypt-hashed passwords.

Manage users with the `webauth-user` tool:
  - Add a user: `docker exec -ti <container name> webauth-user add <username>`
  - Update a user: `docker exec -ti <container name> webauth-user update <username>`
  - Remove a user: `docker exec <container name> webauth-user del <username>`
  - List users: `docker exec <container name> webauth-user list`

## Reverse Proxy

The following sections provide NGINX configurations for setting up a reverse
proxy to this container.

A reverse proxy server can route HTTP requests based on the hostname or URL
path.

### Routing Based on Hostname

In this scenario, each hostname is routed to a different application or
container.

For example, if the reverse proxy server runs on the same machine as this
container, it would proxy all HTTP requests for `makemkv.domain.tld` to
the container at `127.0.0.1:5800`.

Here are the relevant configuration elements to add to the NGINX configuration:

```nginx
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
	default upgrade;
	''      close;
}

upstream docker-makemkv {
	# If the reverse proxy server is not running on the same machine as the
	# Docker container, use the IP of the Docker host here.
	# Make sure to adjust the port according to how port 5800 of the
	# container has been mapped on the host.
	server 127.0.0.1:5800;
}

server {
	[...]

	server_name makemkv.domain.tld;

	location / {
	        proxy_pass http://docker-makemkv;
	}

	location /websockify {
		proxy_pass http://docker-makemkv;
		proxy_http_version 1.1;
		proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
		proxy_read_timeout 86400;
	}

	# Needed when audio support is enabled.
	location /websockify-audio {
		proxy_pass http://docker-makemkv;
		proxy_http_version 1.1;
		proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
		proxy_read_timeout 86400;
	}
}

```

### Routing Based on URL Path

In this scenario, the same hostname is used, but different URL paths route to
different applications or containers. For example, if the reverse proxy server
runs on the same machine as this container, it would proxy all HTTP requests for
`server.domain.tld/filebot` to the container at `127.0.0.1:5800`.

Here are the relevant configuration elements to add to the NGINX configuration:

```nginx
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
	default upgrade;
	''      close;
}

upstream docker-makemkv {
	# If the reverse proxy server is not running on the same machine as the
	# Docker container, use the IP of the Docker host here.
	# Make sure to adjust the port according to how port 5800 of the
	# container has been mapped on the host.
	server 127.0.0.1:5800;
}

server {
	[...]

	location = /makemkv {return 301 $scheme://$http_host/makemkv/;}
	location /makemkv/ {
		proxy_pass http://docker-makemkv/;
		# Uncomment the following line if your Nginx server runs on a port that
		# differs from the one seen by external clients.
		#port_in_redirect off;
		location /makemkv/websockify {
			proxy_pass http://docker-makemkv/websockify;
			proxy_http_version 1.1;
			proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
			proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
			proxy_read_timeout 86400;
		}
		# Needed when audio support is enabled.
		location /makemkv/websockify-audio {
			proxy_pass http://docker-makemkv/websockify-audio;
			proxy_http_version 1.1;
			proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
			proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
			proxy_read_timeout 86400;
		}
	}
}

```

### Web Audio

The container supports streaming audio from the application, played through the
user's web browser. Audio is not supported for VNC clients.

Audio is streamed with the following specification:

  * Raw PCM format
  * 2 channels
  * 16-bit sample depth
  * 44.1kHz sample rate

Enable web audio by setting `WEB_AUDIO` to `1`. See the
[Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for details on
configuring environment variables.

### Web File Manager

The container includes a simple file manager for interacting with container
files through a web browser, supporting operations like renaming, deleting,
uploading, and downloading.

Enable the file manager by setting `WEB_FILE_MANAGER` to `1`. See the
[Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for details on
configuring environment variables.

By default, the container's entire filesystem is not accessible. The
`WEB_FILE_MANAGER_ALLOWED_PATHS` environment variable is a comma-separated list
that specifies which paths within the container are allowed to be accessed. When
set to `AUTO` (the default), it automatically includes commonly used folders and
any folders mapped to the container.

The `WEB_FILE_MANAGER_DENIED_PATHS` environment variable defines which paths are
explicitly denied access by the file manager. A denied path takes precedence
over an allowed one.

## Shell Access

To access the shell of a running container, execute the following command:

```shell
docker exec -ti CONTAINER sh
```

Where `CONTAINER` is the ID or the name of the container used during its
creation.

## Access to Optical Drives

By default, a Docker container does not have access to host's devices. However,
access to one or more devices can be granted with the `--device DEV` parameter
of the `docker run` command.

In Linux, optical drives are represented by two device files named `/dev/srX`
and `/dev/sgY`, where `X` and `Y` are numbers (e.g., `/dev/sr0`, `/dev/sg0` for
the first drive, `/dev/sr1`, `/dev/srg1` for the second, etc). To allow
MakeMKV to access the first drive, use this parameter:

```
--device /dev/sr0 --device /dev/sg1
```

> [!NOTE]
> For an optical drive to be detected by MakeMKV, it is
> mandatory to expose `/dev/sgY` to the container. Exposing `/dev/srX` is
> optional, but performance could be affected.

To identify the correct Linux devices to expose, check the container's log
during startup. Look for messages like:
```
[cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: looking for usable optical drives...
[cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: found optical drive 'hp HLDS DVDRW GUD1N LD02' [/dev/sr0, /dev/sg3]
[cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh:   [ OK ]   associated SCSI Generic (sg) device detected: /dev/sg3.
[cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh:   [ ERR ]  the host device /dev/sg3 is not exposed to the container.
[cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh:   [ OK ]   associated SCSI CD-ROM (sr) device detected: /dev/sr0.
[cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh:   [ WARN ] the host device /dev/sr0 is not exposed to the container.
[cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh:            performance or ability to use the device will suffer.
[cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: no usable optical drives found.
```

This indicates that `/dev/sr0` and `/dev/sg3` need to be exposed to the
container.

> [!TIP]
> View the container’s log by running `docker logs <container_name>`.

Alternatively, identify Linux devices from the host by running:

```
lsscsi -g
```

The output's last two columns for an optical drive indicate the devices to
expose. The following example shows that `/dev/sr0` and `/dev/sg3` should be
exposed:

```
[0:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      TOSHIBA DT01ACA0 A800  /dev/sda   /dev/sg0
[1:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      ST3500418AS      HP34  /dev/sdb   /dev/sg1
[2:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      WDC WD6401AALS-0 3B01  /dev/sdc   /dev/sg2
[4:0:0:0]    cd/dvd  hp HLDS  DVDRW  GUD1N     LD02  /dev/sr0   /dev/sg3
```

## Automatic Disc Ripper

This container includes an automatic disc ripper. When enabled, any DVD or
Blu-ray video disc inserted into an optical drive is automatically ripped.
MakeMKV decrypts and extracts all titles (e.g. main movie,
bonus features) into MKV files.

Enable the automatic disc ripper by setting the environment variable
`AUTO_DISC_RIPPER` to `1`.

To eject the disc when ripping completes, set the environment variable
`AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_EJECT` to `1`.

If multiple drives are available, simultaneous ripping is supported by setting
the environment variable `AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_PARALLEL_RIP` to `1`.

See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for details on
configuring environment variables.

> [!NOTE]
> All titles, audio tracks, chapters, subtitles, etc., are extracted and
> preserved.

> [!NOTE]
> Titles and audio tracks remain in their original formats. They are not
> transcoded or compressed.

> [!NOTE]
> Ripped Blu-ray discs may require significant disk space (e.g., ~40 GB).

> [!NOTE]
> MKV files are written to the container’s /output directory.

> [!NOTE]
> The automatic disc ripper processes all available optical drives.

> [!NOTE]
> When parallel mode is enabled (`AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_PARALLEL_RIP=1`), it is
> recommended to increase the interval for checking new discs using
> `AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_INTERVAL`, to reduce performance impact.

## Notifications

The container supports optional notifications for disc ripping events via [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise), which provides support for 80+ notification services including Discord, Slack, Telegram, Email, Pushover, and many more.

To enable notifications:

1. Create an `apprise.yml` configuration file in your `/config` directory
2. Add your notification service URLs according to the [Apprise documentation](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki)

Example `apprise.yml`:
```yaml
urls:
  - discord://webhook_id/webhook_token
  - mailto://username:password@gmail.com
  - slack://TokenA/TokenB/TokenC
```

Once configured, you'll receive notifications for:
- **Rip Started** - When a disc ripping begins (can be disabled with `NOTIFY_START=0`)
- **Rip Complete** - When a disc is successfully ripped
- **Rip Failed** - When a disc ripping fails or partially fails

Note that notifications require debug logging to be enabled, which happens automatically when an `apprise.yml` file is present.

## Hooks

Custom actions can be performed at various disc-ripping stages using hooks.
Hooks are shell scripts executed by both the MakeMKV GUI and the
automatic disc ripper.

> [!NOTE]
> Hooks are always executed using /bin/sh, regardless of the script’s shebang.

Hooks are optional. By default, none are defined. A hook is executed when a
script exists at a specific path.

The table below lists all supported hooks:

| Container Path | Description | Parameter(s) |
|--------------------|-------------|--------------|
| `/config/hooks/automatic_disc_ripper_started.sh` | Called when the automatic disc ripper starts. | None |
| `/config/hooks/disc_rip_started.sh` | Called when a disc begins ripping automatically. | The first argument is the MakeMKV drive ID. The second argument is the disc label. The third argument is the output directory. |
| `/config/hooks/disc_rip_terminated.sh` | Called when a disc ripping completes. | The first argument is the MakeMKV drive ID. The second argument is the disc label. The third third argument is the output directory. The fourth argument is the status (`SUCCESS` or `FAILURE`). |
| `/config/hooks/disc_rip_skipped.sh` | Called when a disc is skipped. | The first argument is the MakeMKV drive ID. The second argument is the disc label. The third argument is the reason (`ALREADY_PROCESSED`, `NOT_VIDEO_DISC`, or `SERVICE_FIRST_RUN`). |
| `/config/hooks/disc_eject_failed.sh` | Called if the disc eject fails. | The first argument is the MakeMKV drive ID. The second argument is the error message. |
| `/config/hooks/gui_disc_rip_started.sh` | Called when disc ripping starts via the GUI. | The first argument is the disc label. The second argument is the output directory. |
| `/config/hooks/gui_disc_rip_terminated.sh` | Called when disc ripping from GUI completes. | The first argument is the disc label. The second argument is the output directory. The third argument is the status (`SUCCESS` or `FAILURE`). The fourth argument is the message associated to the status. |
| `/config/hooks/gui_raw.sh` | Called on any MakeMKV status update (useful for debugging). | The first argument is the status code. The second argument is the status message. |

> [!TIP]
> Example hooks are installed in `/config/hooks/` with a `.example` suffix. They
> can be used as a starting point.

> [!TIP]
> Use the `INSTALL_PACKAGES` environment variable to install additional
> packages needed by features implemented via hooks.

## Troubleshooting

### Expired Beta Key

If the beta key has expired, simply restart the container. It will automatically
fetch and install the latest key (if available).

> [!NOTE]
> After a beta key expires, it may take a few days for a new key to be released
> by the author of MakeMKV. During this period, the application
> will not function.

> [!NOTE]
> For this solution to work, the `MAKEMKV_KEY` environment variable must be set
> to `BETA`. See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for
> more details.
