      MakeMKV is your one-click solution to convert video that you own into free and
      patents-unencumbered format that can be played everywhere. MakeMKV is a format
      converter, otherwise called "transcoder". It converts the video clips from
      proprietary (and usually encrypted) disc into a set of MKV files, preserving
      most information but not changing it in any way. The MKV format can store
      multiple video/audio tracks with all meta-information and preserve chapters.

      **NOTE**: For the container to have access to your optical drive(s), you
      need to add them to your container configuration. This is done by adding
      a new "Device". An optical drive is represented by two Linux device
      files: "/dev/srX" and "/dev/sgY". For optimal performance, the container
      needs both of them. To determine the right devices to use, start the
      container and look at its log.

      A fully automated mode is also available: insert a DVD or Blu-ray disc into an
      optical drive and let {{ app.friendly_name }} rips it without any user interaction.

      - title: Access to Optical Drives
        level: 2
        content: |-
          By default, a Docker container does not have access to host's devices. However,
          access to one or more devices can be granted with the `--device DEV` parameter
          of the `docker run` command.

          In Linux, optical drives are represented by two device files named `/dev/srX`
          and `/dev/sgY`, where `X` and `Y` are numbers (e.g., `/dev/sr0`, `/dev/sg0` for
          the first drive, `/dev/sr1`, `/dev/srg1` for the second, etc). To allow
          {{ app.friendly_name }} to access the first drive, use this parameter:

          ```
          --device /dev/sr0 --device /dev/sg1
          ```

          > [!NOTE]
          > For an optical drive to be detected by {{ app.friendly_name }}, it is
          > mandatory to expose `/dev/sgY` to the container. Exposing `/dev/srX` is
          > optional, but performance could be affected.

          To identify the correct Linux devices to expose, check the container's log
          during startup. Look for messages like:
          ```
          [cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: looking for usable optical drives...
          [cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: found optical drive 'hp HLDS DVDRW GUD1N LD02' [/dev/sr0, /dev/sg3]
          [cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh:   [ OK ]   associated SCSI Generic (sg) device detected: /dev/sg3.
          [cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh:   [ ERR ]  the host device /dev/sg3 is not exposed to the container.
          [cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh:   [ OK ]   associated SCSI CD-ROM (sr) device detected: /dev/sr0.
          [cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh:   [ WARN ] the host device /dev/sr0 is not exposed to the container.
          [cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh:            performance or ability to use the device will suffer.
          [cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: no usable optical drives found.
          ```

          This indicates that `/dev/sr0` and `/dev/sg3` need to be exposed to the
          container.

          > [!TIP]
          > View the container’s log by running `docker logs <container_name>`.

          Alternatively, identify Linux devices from the host by running:

          ```
          lsscsi -g
          ```

          The output's last two columns for an optical drive indicate the devices to
          expose. The following example shows that `/dev/sr0` and `/dev/sg3` should be
          exposed:

          ```
          [0:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      TOSHIBA DT01ACA0 A800  /dev/sda   /dev/sg0
          [1:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      ST3500418AS      HP34  /dev/sdb   /dev/sg1
          [2:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      WDC WD6401AALS-0 3B01  /dev/sdc   /dev/sg2
          [4:0:0:0]    cd/dvd  hp HLDS  DVDRW  GUD1N     LD02  /dev/sr0   /dev/sg3
          ```
      - title: Automatic Disc Ripper
        level: 2
        content: |-
          This container includes an automatic disc ripper. When enabled, any DVD or
          Blu-ray video disc inserted into an optical drive is automatically ripped.
          {{ app.friendly_name }} decrypts and extracts all titles (e.g. main movie,
          bonus features) into MKV files.

          Enable the automatic disc ripper by setting the environment variable
          `AUTO_DISC_RIPPER` to `1`.

          To eject the disc when ripping completes, set the environment variable
          `AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_EJECT` to `1`.

          If multiple drives are available, simultaneous ripping is supported by setting
          the environment variable `AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_PARALLEL_RIP` to `1`.

          See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for details on
          configuring environment variables.

          > [!NOTE]
          > All titles, audio tracks, chapters, subtitles, etc., are extracted and
          > preserved.

          > [!NOTE]
          > Titles and audio tracks remain in their original formats. They are not
          > transcoded or compressed.

          > [!NOTE]
          > Ripped Blu-ray discs may require significant disk space (e.g., ~40 GB).

          > [!NOTE]
          > MKV files are written to the container’s /output directory.

          > [!NOTE]
          > The automatic disc ripper processes all available optical drives.

          > [!NOTE]
          > When parallel mode is enabled (`AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_PARALLEL_RIP=1`), it is
          > recommended to increase the interval for checking new discs using
          > `AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_INTERVAL`, to reduce performance impact.
      - title: Hooks
        level: 2
        content: |-
          Custom actions can be performed at various disc-ripping stages using hooks.
          Hooks are shell scripts executed by both the {{ app.friendly_name }} GUI and the
          automatic disc ripper.

          > [!NOTE]
          > Hooks are always executed using /bin/sh, regardless of the script’s shebang.

          Hooks are optional. By default, none are defined. A hook is executed when a
          script exists at a specific path.

          The table below lists all supported hooks:

          | Container Path | Description | Parameter(s) |
          |--------------------|-------------|--------------|
          | `/config/hooks/automatic_disc_ripper_started.sh` | Called when the automatic disc ripper starts. | None |
          | `/config/hooks/disc_rip_started.sh` | Called when a disc begins ripping automatically. | The first argument is the {{ app.friendly_name }} drive ID. The second argument is the disc label. The third argument is the output directory. |
          | `/config/hooks/disc_rip_terminated.sh` | Called when a disc ripping completes. | The first argument is the {{ app.friendly_name }} drive ID. The second argument is the disc label. The third third argument is the output directory. The fourth argument is the status (`SUCCESS` or `FAILURE`). |
          | `/config/hooks/disc_rip_skipped.sh` | Called when a disc is skipped. | The first argument is the {{ app.friendly_name }} drive ID. The second argument is the disc label. The third argument is the reason (`ALREADY_PROCESSED`, `NOT_VIDEO_DISC`, or `SERVICE_FIRST_RUN`). |
          | `/config/hooks/disc_eject_failed.sh` | Called if the disc eject fails. | The first argument is the {{ app.friendly_name }} drive ID. The second argument is the error message. |
          | `/config/hooks/gui_disc_rip_started.sh` | Called when disc ripping starts via the GUI. | The first argument is the disc label. The second argument is the output directory. |
          | `/config/hooks/gui_disc_rip_terminated.sh` | Called when disc ripping from GUI completes. | The first argument is the disc label. The second argument is the output directory. The third argument is the status (`SUCCESS` or `FAILURE`). The fourth argument is the message associated to the status. |
          | `/config/hooks/gui_raw.sh` | Called on any {{ app.friendly_name }} status update (useful for debugging). | The first argument is the status code. The second argument is the status message. |

          > [!TIP]
          > Example hooks are installed in `/config/hooks/` with a `.example` suffix. They
          > can be used as a starting point.

          > [!TIP]
          > Use the `INSTALL_PACKAGES` environment variable to install additional
          > packages needed by features implemented via hooks.
      - title: Troubleshooting
        level: 2
      - title: Expired Beta Key
        level: 3
        content: |-
          If the beta key has expired, simply restart the container. It will automatically
          fetch and install the latest key (if available).

          > [!NOTE]
          > After a beta key expires, it may take a few days for a new key to be released
          > by the author of {{ app.friendly_name }}. During this period, the application
          > will not function.

          > [!NOTE]
          > For this solution to work, the `MAKEMKV_KEY` environment variable must be set
          > to `BETA`. See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for
          > more details.
