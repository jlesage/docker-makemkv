MakeMKV is your one-click solution to convert video that you own into free and
patents-unencumbered format that can be played everywhere. MakeMKV is a format
converter, otherwise called "transcoder". It converts the video clips from
proprietary (and usually encrypted) disc into a set of MKV files, preserving
most information but not changing it in any way. The MKV format can store
multiple video/audio tracks with all meta-information and preserve chapters.

[span style='color: red;'][b]NOTE:[/b][/span] For the container to have
access to your optical drive(s), you need to allow access to the proper
Linux devices by adding (one for each of them) the parameter
[b][i]--device DEV[/i][/b] in the [i]Extra Parameters[/i] field (shown when
[i]Advanced View[/i] is enabled).[br]
An optical drive is represented by two Linux device files: [b][i]/dev/srX[/i][/b]
and [b][i]/dev/sgY[/i][/b].  For optimal performance, the container needs both
of them.  So if your optical drive is represented by [b][i]/dev/sr0[/i][/b] and
[b][i]/dev/sg2[/i][/b], you need to add
[b][i]--device /dev/sr0 --device /dev/sg2[/i][/b] to the [i]Extra Parameters[/i]
field.[br]
To determine the right devices to use, start the container and looks at its
log.

      <title level="2">Access to Optical Drive(s)</title>
      <content>
By default, a Docker container doesn't have access to host's devices.  However,
access to one or more devices can be granted with the `--device DEV` parameter.

In the Linux world, an optical drive is represented by two different device
files: `/dev/srX` and `/dev/sgY`, where `X` and `Y` are numbers.

For best performance, it is recommended to expose both these devices to the
container.  For example, for an optical drive represented by `/dev/sr0` and
`/dev/sg1`, the following parameters would be added to the `docker run`
command:
```
--device /dev/sr0 --device /dev/sg1
```

**NOTE**: For an optical drive to be detected by MakeMKV, it is mandatory to
expose `/dev/sgY` to the container.  `/dev/srX` is optional, but performance
could be affected.

The easiest way to determine the right Linux devices to expose is to run the
container (without `--device` parameter) and look at its log: during the
startup, messages similar to these ones are outputed:
```
[cont-init.d] 95-check-optical-drive.sh: executing...
[cont-init.d] 95-check-optical-drive.sh: looking for usable optical drives...
[cont-init.d] 95-check-optical-drive.sh: found optical drive [/dev/sr0, /dev/sg3], but it is not usable because:
[cont-init.d] 95-check-optical-drive.sh:   --> the host device /dev/sr0 is not exposed to the container.
[cont-init.d] 95-check-optical-drive.sh:   --> the host device /dev/sg3 is not exposed to the container.
[cont-init.d] 95-check-optical-drive.sh: no usable optical drive found.
[cont-init.d] 95-check-optical-drive.sh: exited 0.
```

In this case, it's clearly indicated that `/dev/sr0` and `/dev/sg3` needs to be
exposed to the container.

      <title level="2">Automatic Disc Ripper</title>
      <content>
This container has an automatic disc ripper built-in.  When enabled, any DVD or
Blu-ray video disc inserted into an optical drive is automatically ripped.  In
other words, MakeMKV decrypts and extracts all titles (such as the main movie,
bonus features, etc) from the disc to MKV files.

To enable the automatic disc ripper, set the environment variable
`AUTO_DISC_RIPPER` to `1`.

To eject the disc from the drive when ripping is terminated, set the environment
variable `AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_EJECT` to `1`.

If multiple drives are available, discs can be ripped simultaneously by
setting the environment variable `AUTO_DISC_RIPPER_PARALLEL_RIP` to `1`.

See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for details
about setting environment variables.

**NOTE**: All titles, audio tracks, chapters, subtitles, etc are
        extracted/preserved.

**NOTE**: Titles and audio tracks are kept in their original format.  They are
        not transcoded or converted to other formats or into smaller sizes.

**NOTE**: Ripped Blu-ray discs can take a large amount of disc space (~40GB).

**NOTE**: MKV Files are written to the `/output` folder of the container.

**NOTE**: The automatic disc ripper processes all available optical drives.

    <section>
      <title level="3">Expired Beta Key</title>
      <content>
If the beta key is expired, just restart the container to automatically fetch
and install the latest one.

**NOTE**: Once beta key expires, it can take few days before a new key is made
available by the author of MakeMKV.  During this time, the application is not
functional.

**NOTE**: For this solution to work, the `MAKEMKV_KEY` environment variable must
be set to `BETA`.  See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)
section for more details.
